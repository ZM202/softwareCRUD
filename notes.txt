// Use the mental framework of "CRUD" to make routes to the 
//following sections:

// Home page
// Read all companies (write this route first, but it should 
//appear after Create when you're done)
// Create new company details page
// Update a company
// Delete a company
// Don't forget to add forms to the correct pages in order 
//to create a new company and to update a company.
